NAME:  A Dataset That Is 44% Outliers
TYPE:  Census
SIZE:  43 observations, one variable with case labels

DESCRIPTIVE ABSTRACT:

The data consist of the numbers of days served in office for the 43 
Presidents of the United States as of 4 February 2004. 

SOURCE:

The data were extracted from tables in the 2001 _World Almanac_ .

VARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS:

Columns   Variables

1-14      Last name of President (text, spelled with no embedded
          spaces)
15-18     days in office (counts)

Values are separated by (a variable number of) blanks. There are no
missing values.

STORY BEHIND THE DATA:

The data were gathered to illustrate kinds of outliers. The main pattern 
in the data is that the majority of presidents served either one or two 
full terms. However, about 44% of the observations deviate from this pattern, 
and could be considered outliers.

PEDAGOGICAL NOTES:

The data illustrate outliers that are not mistakes and not observations 
that are unusually high or low. The reasons for them are all interesting 
historically. They illustrate that "outliers" need not be errors but may 
instead be particularly interesting cases. The data also illustrate that 
different data displays may differ in their ability to reveal interesting 
data structure.
